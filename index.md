# X2CScope

X2CScope is a runtime online debugging firmware tool for Embedded systems, MCUs. It works in RUN and DEBUGGING mode. 
It is for generic use in any embedded application and perfectly fits for signal processing related solutions.


Have you faced difficulties to debug control applications? It is not easy because the variables are changing continuously by the time.
There are also cases where you cannot stop the running program because the signals disappearing or just the hardware breaks down. 
Typical examples are measuring, streaming data collection, DCDC converters, or motor control application.
Additionally it would be nice to see the signals by the time domain.
So many times the standard debugging methods are not enough and more sophisticated debugging tools are needed. 


This is the field where X2C Scope thrives and can reduce the development cycle, and therefore, the time-to-market.
